# CodeBow - Game Prototype for STEMist 2.0 Case Competition

## Introduction
Welcome to CodeBow, a captivating game prototype developed for the STEMist 2.0 Case Competition submission. CodeBow is an exciting and immersive gaming experience that combines creativity, problem-solving, and STEM knowledge. In this game, players embark on a thrilling journey where they can explore procedurally generated terrains, engage in challenging battles with physics-based projectiles, and utilize multi-texturing techniques to enhance the visual appeal of the game world. CodeBow has been meticulously crafted, with all graphics output designed entirely from scratch using powerful graphics development tools such as OpenGL, LWJGL, and GLFW. Additionally, Blender and Eclipse were used for other development aspects, making this game an impressive showcase of cutting-edge technology.

## Features
### 1. Procedural Terrain Generation
CodeBow utilizes advanced procedural terrain generation algorithms to create vast and diverse landscapes for players to explore. Every time the game is played, the terrain is generated procedurally, ensuring a unique experience in each playthrough. The terrains are realistic and richly detailed, providing an immersive environment for players to interact with.

### 2. Multi-Texturing for Enhanced Visuals
To elevate the visual appeal of CodeBow, multi-texturing techniques have been employed. This innovative approach allows the game to apply multiple textures to a single surface, creating a more detailed and realistic appearance. The result is stunning environments with a sense of depth and complexity that draws players deeper into the game world.

### 3. Graphics Output Using OpenGL, LWJGL, and GLFW
The graphics output of CodeBow has been entirely crafted from scratch using a powerful combination of OpenGL, LWJGL, and GLFW. OpenGL is a high-performance graphics library that enables smooth rendering and efficient handling of complex graphical elements. LWJGL provides a Java binding for OpenGL, allowing seamless integration with the game's Java-based codebase. GLFW facilitates window and input management, ensuring smooth interactions with the game environment.

### 4. Support for .obj File Reading
CodeBow incorporates support for reading .obj files, a popular file format for 3D models. This feature enables the seamless integration of custom 3D models and assets created with external tools like Blender. As a result, developers can easily incorporate unique and intricate designs, enriching the game with diverse characters, objects, and elements.

### 5. Advanced Physics System for Projectiles and Motion
The game's physics system is carefully designed to provide realistic projectile motion and movement for various in-game entities. This system ensures that projectiles follow accurate trajectories based on their initial conditions, environmental factors, and other influencing elements. Players can expect thrilling battles with physics-based projectiles, adding an exciting layer of challenge and strategy to the gameplay.

## Installation
1. Clone the CodeBow repository from GitHub Repo.
2. Install Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or later.
3. Set up Eclipse IDE for Java development.
4. Install Blender for 3D model creation (optional).
